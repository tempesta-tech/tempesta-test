"""
Test for Hash scheduler under heavy load. Uri should be pinned to a single
server connection. Server owning that connection connection should get all the
requests. But when the connection is down, the load will be distributed to
another connection. Once primary connection is back online it should again
get all the load.

It's not possible to get per-connection request statistics from the backend,
so all the assertions in the tests below can be done only at server level.
Not a big problem since there is test_hash_func.py tests, which works at
per-connection level. Tests in this file extend test_hash_func by the
following checks:
- Hash scheduler performs as expected under significant load;
- Load distribution works as expected if backend connections are closed time to
time.
