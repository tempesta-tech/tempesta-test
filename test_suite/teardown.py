"""
Implementation of a "teardown" routine which is executed after every test.

A problem: Python interpreter doesn't exit until all threads are exited.
That means that when a test finishes, it hangs if there are backend threads
running in background. So these threads should be terminated somehow.
We don't want to write some boilerplate code at the end of each test,
so here we have code that does it automatically.
